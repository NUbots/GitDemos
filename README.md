# GitDemos
A testing ground for junior NUbots members to try Git and GitHub

## What do I do?

Follow these steps to get started, then follow the steps in `Tasks.md`.

1. Clone this repository (or "repo" for short). Use a linux or MacOS command line to swap to your source code/programs directory, then run this command: `git clone https://github.com/NUbots/GitDemos.git`.

2. Open the [git guide on NUbook](https://nubook.nubots.net/guides/general/git) (this step is in large part just so you know it exists)

3. Open `Tasks.md` and complete the steps.

4. If you have some experience with this stuff or you finish early, you can help someone else who is still trying.
